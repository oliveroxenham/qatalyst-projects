    "estimatedReductions": {
      "title": "Estimated reductions (over project duration)",
      "response": "The estimated reductions over the project duration were determined to be 21,171,578 tCO₂e. This value was extracted from multiple sources: A table in the project documentation explicitly states the \"Net estimated emission reductions in the project area, measured against the without-project scenario\" as 21,171,578 for \"Achievements during the Project Lifetime\" [1]. This same figure is corroborated in another text source, which presents it in a slightly different format but with the same value [2]. The determination of this value is likely based on comprehensive calculations and modelling of the project's impact over its entire duration. It represents the total expected reduction in greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the project activities when compared to a baseline scenario without the project. It's important to note that this figure represents the cumulative reductions over the entire project lifetime, not an annual figure. The project is classified as a \"large project\" due to its significant impact, with annual reductions exceeding 300,000 tonnes of CO₂e [3]."
    },
    "totalEstimatedReductions": {
      "title": "Total estimated reductions",
      "response": "The value for Total estimated reductions was determined based on the following analysis: The most relevant information was found in source [1], which provides a table of achievements during the project lifetime. The table in [1] lists \"Net estimated emission reductions in the project area, measured against the without-project scenario\" as 21,171,578. This value is the most comprehensive and appears to represent the total estimated reductions for the entire project lifetime. The unit tCO₂e is not explicitly stated in the source, but it is the standard unit for GHG emission reductions and is consistent with other sources provided. Other sources, such as [2] and [3], provide partial or annual data, but do not give a clear total for the entire project. [4] shows a total of 1,641,141, but this appears to be for a shorter period (2018-2019) and not the full project lifetime. Therefore, 21,171,578 tCO₂e is the best match for the total estimated reductions over the project's lifetime."

    "communityHealth": {
      "title": "Community health, safety and security",
      "response": "The answer 'Satisfactory' is based on the following evidence from the document sources: 1. The project provides comprehensive health and safety measures for both staff and local communities: WCS Health and Safety policies protect all project staff and counterparts [1] [2]. Health and accident insurance is provided to staff, covering all healthcare expenses in case of work-related incidents or illnesses [1] [2]. 2. Training and capacity building for community safety: Community members involved in project activities like patrolling and eco-tourism receive safety and security training, typically on an annual basis [3]. Training on community patrol and SMART reports in Khmer provides information on safety and security for patrol teams [3]. 3. Community infrastructure and health initiatives: The project supports various community infrastructure projects, including road repair, bridge construction, and installation of road drainage [4]. Health-related activities include installation of pump wells, piped water systems, construction of toilets, mobile health clinics, and community funds for health emergencies [4]. 4. Monitoring and risk management: There is a clear plan for monitoring community-related High Conservation Values (HCVs), including demographic and socioeconomic monitoring [5]. The project has developed specific guidance for managing risks with local communities during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. 5. Workplace health and safety: Staff are required to inform project management of unsafe conditions, illnesses, or injuries for prompt remedial action [7]. WCS is committed to providing a safe working environment for all [2]. These measures demonstrate a comprehensive approach to community health, safety, and security, justifying the 'Satisfactory' rating."
